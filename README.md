Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- It is the systemic application of engineering princples, methods and tools to develop and maintain a high quality software system. 
- helps in creation of software applications and systems that help in aspect of modern life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- development of programming language
- establishment of software engineering as a discipline
- rise of agile methodologies 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirement- Gathering and documenting user needs and requrmemt
- Design- design of software architecture and user interface
- Implimentation- writing codes and building softwares
- Testing- running test so as to meet the quality standards
- Deployment- releasing software to the users
- Miantenance- providing updates and enhancements 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall involves a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile an iterative and and an incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaborations and respond to change 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Dev- writing codes and implementing sofware solution.
- Q assuarence Eng- ensure software quality by designing and executing tests
- Project manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects
  


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDE - Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
- VCS - tracks changes to source code and coordinating work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Tight deadlines which may compromise quality
- technical debt
- ways to overcome- effective communication, agile methodologies 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing- testing individual components in software
- intergration- testing interactions between different components
- system- testiing the entire software system as a whole
- acceptance- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- It is the crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
